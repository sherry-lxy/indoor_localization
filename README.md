# Accurate Indoor Localization Using Multi-View Image Distance

Due to the increasing complexity of indoor facilities such as shopping malls and train stations, 
there is a need for a technology that can find the current location of a user using a smartphone or other devices, 
even in indoor areas where GPS signals cannot be received. 
Indoor localization methods based on image recognition have been proposed as solutions. 
While many localization methods have been proposed for outdoor use, 
indoor localization has difficultly in achieving high accuracy from just one image taken by the user (query image), 
because there are many similar objects (walls, desks, etc.) and there are only a few cues that can be used for localization. 
In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization method that uses multi-view images. 
The basic idea is to improve the localization quality by retrieving the pre-captured image with location information (reference image) that best matches the multi-view query image taken from multiple directions around the user. 
To this end, we introduce a simple metric to evaluate the distance between multi-view images. 
Experiments on two image datasets of real indoor scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
